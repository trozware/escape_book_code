# Escape from Tutorial Hell: Code

This repo contains all the downloadable projects and files for use with the 1st edition of the **[Escape from Tutorial Hell](https://troz.net/books/escape)** book by Sarah Reichelt.

You can buy the book from [Gumroad](https://sarahreichelt.gumroad.com/l).

If youâ€™d like to check out the start of the book including the table of contents and the first chapter, you can read it online at [Escape from Tutorial Hell Sample](https://troz.net/books/escape_sample.html).

To follow along with the book, click the big green **Code** button and select **Download ZIP**. Please download instead of cloning as this gives you a clean set of files, without my source control.

When running any of the sample projects, you'll need to select your own team in the **Signing & Capabilities** section of the target settings.
